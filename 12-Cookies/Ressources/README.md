#6-Hidden_folders Breach

##Research explanation
- While testing several things for the Leave Feedback breach, I test several html injection, including this one:
\<a onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)"\>xxs link\</a\>
- After the reload of the page, an alert window is appearing and is showing one cookie detail of the website:
I_am_admin=68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327
- We can also retrieve the cookie using the developer mode of the browser (Application Tab).
- It seems it is a hash. Let's decrypt ut using the dcode hash website -  https://www.dcode.fr/fonction-hash
- It is a MD5 hash retrieving 'false' when it is decoded.
- Let's try to change the cookie value to 'true'. After encoding it in MD5 using the website, I obtained the below hash:
b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09
- Let's load it on the website. To create a cookie on a website using js: document.cookie = "username=John Doe";
In our case: document.cookie = "I_am_admin=b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09"; which needs to be loaded in the website console.
- After teh reresh of the page, a pop up window apperead:
Good job! Flag : df2eb4ba34ed059a1e3e89ff4dfc13445f104a1a52295214def1c4fb1693a5c3

##Breach Details 
- It is a cross-site request forgery attack.
- Use only cookies to identify yourself to get specific access of a website is not a best practice. It should  be either combined with another way to authenticate yourself (token) or follow the bellow recommendations to avoid issues
- According to OWASP, Web Cookies are often a key attack vector for malicious users (typically targeting other users) and the application should always take due diligence to protect cookies. Cookies can be used for a multitude of reasons, such as: session management / personalization / tracking. In order to secure cookie data, the industry has developed means to help lock down these cookies and limit their attack surface.

Recommendation: 
- A way to secure a cookie is to use the HttpOnly attribute used to help prevent attacks such as session leakage, since it does not allow the cookie to be accessed via a client-side script such as JavaScript.
This doesnâ€™t limit the whole attack surface of XSS attacks, as an attacker could still send request in place of the user, but limits immensely the reach of XSS attack vectors.
C- ookies that are used for sensitive information (such as indicating authentication) should have a short lifetime, with the SameSite attribute set to Strict or Lax. In browsers that support SameSite, this ensures that the authentication cookie isn't sent with cross-site requests. This would make the request effectively unauthenticated to the application server.
- Several  other best practices are available in the OWASP documentation: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/02-Testing_for_Cookies_Attributes // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#creating_cookies


##How to:
- Get the cookie info from the Application tab of the devloper mode of the browser
- Decode the hash using https://www.dcode.fr/fonction-hash
- Encode in MD5 the word 'true' using https://www.dcode.fr/fonction-hash
- Load the  below js command in the website console:
document.cookie = "I_am_admin=b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09"
- The flag appeared.
